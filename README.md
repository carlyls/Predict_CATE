# Predict_CATE

This repo contains code to implement methods and simulations to predict conditional average treatment effects in a target setting, based on data from multiple studies. The purpose of this work is to be able to effectively assess uncertainty in a target sample that does not come from a particular trial, when we allow for between-study heterogeneity in the conditional average treatment effects.
